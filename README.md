This project implements a Python-based sales analytics system designed to handle messy e-commerce transaction data. The system reads pipe-delimited sales records, resolves encoding and formatting issues, removes invalid transactions based on defined business rules, and cleans valid data for analysis. It further simulates product information retrieval, analyzes sales patterns and customer behavior, and generates a structured output for decision-making. The project follows a modular design with separate utility files for file handling, data processing, and API interaction, ensuring clarity, scalability, and maintainability.
